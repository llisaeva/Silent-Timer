__Compatible with Android 4.2 Jelly Bean (API 17) and newer versions.__

Has five screens: 
+ __Main screen__ - displayed on app start, shows all created silent intervals.
+ __Immediate screen__ - mutes audio starting from the current time, for a time increment selected by the user on this screen. This screen opens after clicking `+` on the bar in the Main screen.
+ __Schedule screen__ - schedules either a repeating or non-repeating silent interval.
+ __Edit List screen__ - user can reorder list entries, and delete selected ones.
+ __Settings__ - lets the user configure the theme (Dark Theme or Light Theme), the time increment choices displayed on the Immediate screen (defaults are 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours), and debug options.
